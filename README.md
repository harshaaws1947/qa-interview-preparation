## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Java Basics
Start with core Java concepts:
- OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- Collections framework (List, Set, Map)
- Exception handling
- Java 8 features (Lambdas, Streams)

### 2. Selenium WebDriver
Master test automation:
- Locator strategies (ID, CSS, XPath)
- Wait mechanisms (Implicit, Explicit, Fluent)
- Page Object Model
- Actions class for advanced interactions

### 3. API Testing
Understand REST APIs:
- HTTP methods and status codes
- REST Assured framework
- JSON handling and validation
- Authentication methods

### 4. SQL
Practice database queries:
- JOIN operations
- Subqueries and CTEs
- Window functions
- Common interview problems

### 5. Framework Design
Build robust frameworks:
- Design patterns (POM, Singleton, Factory)
- Data-driven testing
- Reporting and logging
- CI/CD integration

### 6. Behavioral Questions
Prepare STAR stories for:
- Conflict resolution
- Leadership experiences
- Failure and learning
- Process improvements

## Interview Tips

### Technical Round
1. **Think out loud** - Explain your approach

3. **Start simple** - Then optimize
4. **Handle edge cases** - NULL values, empty inputs
5. **Know your resume** - Be ready to discuss projects

### Behavioral Round
1. **Use STAR method** - Situation, Task, Action, Result
2. **Prepare 5-7 stories** - Cover different scenarios
3. **Be specific** - Use numbers and metrics
4. **Show growth** - Discuss learnings from failures
5. **Be honest** - Don't exaggerate

### Coding Round
1. **Understand requirements** - Read carefully
2. **Write clean code** - Naming, structure
3. **Test your code** - Think of test cases
4. **Optimize** - Time and space complexity
5. **Communicate** - Explain trade-offs
